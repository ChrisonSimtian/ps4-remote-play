PS4 Remote Play client (WIP)
============================

**Goal**: having an open source implementation of the PS4 Remote Play protocol
as well as a client which works on Linux. Both local and remote remote play
should be supported.

**Current status**:

 - Supports the initial registration protocol.
 - Supports local "wake on LAN".
